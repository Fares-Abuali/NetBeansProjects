        // so now if I invoked the method f.exists(); it will return false, because the file is not existent in the machine

        //Invoking the constructor of PrintWriter may throw an I/O exception. Java forces you to write the code to
        //deal with this type of exception. For simplicity, we declare throws IOException in the main method header (line 2).

//Programmers often forget to close the file ,so:
//    try(PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(f);) { // this is called a resource

//        
//    }
      //After the block is finished, the resourceâ€™s close() method is automatically invoked to close the resource
      //. Using try-with-resources can not only avoid errors but also make the code simpler.
